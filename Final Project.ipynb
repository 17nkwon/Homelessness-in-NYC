    "New York City has the largest homeless population in the United States. According to the [Department of Housing & Urban Development](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-data-show-nearly-80-000-homeless-in-new-york-city-11571922000) nearly 80,000 NYC residents are homeless. It's unclear why NYC has such a high concentration of homelessness. For reference, the second-highest city in terms of homelessness is Los Angeles, which has more residents than NYC, but has roughly 40,000 fewer homeless people (source: [DataLab](https://datalab.usaspending.gov/homelessness-analysis.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesized that the high cost of housing in New York City and the few resources for the homeless (shelters, soup kitchens) contribute to the high concentration of homelessness. To explore these claims, we collected and analyzed data on homeless populations, homeless shelters, and housing costs in each of NYC’s five boroughs: Manhattan, The Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island."

To compensate for this difference, we took a [weighted mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean).\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine how each housing cost should be weighed in our average, we referenced [Move.org](https://www.move.org/states-most-mortgage-free-homeowners/) to determine the percentage of homeowners that had mortages and the percentage who were mortgage-free in New York. Unfortunately, we could not find a percentage per borough, so our costs are a generalized estimate. For the weighted mean of homeowner costs, we multiplied the median monthly mortgage costs by 60.93% which is how many New Yorkers have a mortgage plus the median monthly costs without a mortgage multiplied by 39.07% which is how many New Yorkers are mortgage-free. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",

    "<center><i>weighted average of monthly median homeowner costs = (0.6093 * mortage_costs) + (0.3907 * without_mortgage_costs)</i></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is entered into a new column called 'home_costs'.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Now, to calculate a weighted average median housing cost between homeowners and renters, we took a weighted mean of the median costs using the homeowner percentages in our dataframe (the owner-occupied housing unit rate). We made a new column called 'renter_percent' to determine how many people are renters. We multiplied the percentage of people that own and live in their houses by the average monthly median costs of homeowners (which we calculated before). We added this product to the percentage of renters multiplied by the median gross rent. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<center><i>weighted average of monthly median housing cost = (homeowner_percent * home_costs) + (renter_percent * gross_rent)</i></center>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Finally, we multiplied the mean monthly housing costs by 12 to calculate the yearly costs."

    "The graph above depicts each borough's yearly median income versus its yearly average median housing cost. This data verifies that areas with high household incomes also have high housing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "After making and viewing this graph, we realized that it is important to consider what percentage of peoples' income is going towards their housing costs. For instance, a wealthy person in Manhattan may be paying a considerable amount in housing costs, but this may only be a small percentage of their takehome pay. Meanwhile, a resident of The Bronx may be paying less in housing costs, but this amount could be a large portion of their monthly income.\n",
    "\n",
    "We created a second plot to take these proportions into consideration. We also created a plot of the percentage of the total NYC homeless population in each borough, for reference (using the data from our 'table' dataframe in 2A)."

    "This new plot shows that people residing in The Bronx are contributing about 40% of their yearly income towards housing. Meanwhile, people in Manhattan and Staten Island contribute considerably less of their income (about 25%) to housing. This gives us a better insight into the impact of high housing costs in each neighborhood.\n",

    "# 4. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we believed that NYC neighborhoods with higher housing costs would have a higher concentration of homelessness. After scraping and analyzing our data, we have found this to be false. In fact, we found that boroughs with lower housing costs have much higher concentrations of homelessness.\n",
    "\n",
    "We needed to account for the income bracket of each borough. After taking this into consideration, we realized that areas with low housing costs have relatively low income brackets, while areas with high housing costs have much, much higher income brackets. Therefore, people in areas like Manhattan are not as burdened by the cost of housing as compared to people in The Bronx, who spend almost half of their income just on their home payments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering this important factor, it is clear why homelessness is most concentrated in The Bronx. People living in this area have (on average) a low yearly income, and many of them likely have trouble paying their relatively high housing payments. These individuals may become forced to prioritize other expenses (food, family, etc.) over their housing, which may drive them into homelessness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data shows that The Bronx only has 5 homeless shelters within a 5 mile radius of the city center. Clearly, this neighborhood is especially in need of more resources for the homeless, as it contains about 38% of NYC's total homeless population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rising housing costs will continue to raise the number of homeless people in The Bronx (source: [Point2Homes](https://www.point2homes.com/news/canada-real-estate/18-north-american-cities-home-price-staggering-jumps.html)). Establishing more shelters in the area is not a solution, but it may be beneficial."
